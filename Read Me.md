1. The run_analysis.R is the final code that does the following:
- Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set, fitting into appropriate columns and  making the new data set presenting the results from all 30 subjects.
- Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, which left the new data set with 81 variables (79 measurements)
- Changed the labels of activities in the original data set to literal names of the activities 
- Labeled the data set with descriptive variable names and expanded the abbreviations
- Calculated the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. The data set named "newdata.txt" is the final, tidy data set for further analysis.

3. The Code Book.md contains the descriptions of the final data set.
